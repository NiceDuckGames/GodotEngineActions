# GodotEngineActions
EngineActions is a plugin for the Godot Game Engine that allows the user to record, create, and edit their interactions with the editor. It provides developers a way to streamline their workflows by creating macros and automating boilerplate aspects of their projects. It also comes with an editor for these Actions, allowing users to modify, play back, and re-order individual Commands within the Action through the editor UI.

## Dependencies
This plugin has a couple of plugins from our Plugin Development Suite as dependencies. Specifically GodotSense and GDVN. These are included in this repo, and should not require separate installation. The instructions for these plugins can be found in their own repositories here:
